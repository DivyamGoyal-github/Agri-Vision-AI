# Agri-Vision-AI

## Mission

To empower farmers with an AI-driven solution that enables early, accessible, and accurate detection of crop diseases, ultimately improving crop yield, reducing pesticide use, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

## Objectives

- Build an AI model that can classify crop diseases from images
- To give information on various parameters regarding the current crop status
- Integrate a user-friendly interface for farmers to upload images
- Link the model output to a language model (LLM) that provides treatment suggestions
- Support multilingual and voice-based interaction to ensure inclusivity
- Ensure robustness and scalability of the solution for real-world deployment
- To generate comprehensive reports regarding the crops, including news of seasonal and anomalous hazards if possible

## DataSets Used
After extensive research and evaluation of multiple publicly available plant disease datasets, the following most relevant and diverse sources were selected and merged. Through careful augmentation and balancing, a unified dataset has been created, consisting of 77 well-defined classes with approximately 1,290 images per class, ensuring consistency, diversity, and robustness for model training.
