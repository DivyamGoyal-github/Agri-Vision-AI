# Agri-Vision-AI

## Mission

To empower farmers with an AI-driven solution that enables early, accessible, and accurate detection of crop diseases, ultimately improving crop yield, reducing pesticide use, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

## Objectives

- Build an AI model that can classify crop diseases from images
- Integrate a user-friendly interface for farmers to upload images
- Link the model output to a language model (LLM) that provides treatment suggestions
- Support multilingual and voice-based interaction to ensure inclusivity
- Ensure robustness and scalability of the solution for real-world deployment
